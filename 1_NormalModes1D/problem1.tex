\section*{Normal Modes in 1D$^1$}

\textbf{a. Discrete}\\

Consider a system of N particles which is subject to a restoring force proportional to the separation to the equilibrium position ( $ F \alpha x $ ). How many normal modes has this system?\\

\textbf{b. Continuous }\\

Consider now a continuous system of particles confined to a length $L$ and fixed borders. Which are normal wave lengths ($\lambda_n$), the normal frequencies  ($\nu_n$) in terms of $\nu$(the speed of waves in the medium) and is it correct to think that this system has infinite normal modes. If the it does not have infinite normal modes, give a order of magnitude of the number of normal modes.
