\section*{Normal Modes in 1D\footnote{A. P. French. Vibrations and Waves. 2003}}

\textbf{a. Discrete}\\

Consider a system of N particles which is subject to a restoring force proportional to the separation to the equilibrium position ( $F \quad \alpha \quad x$ ). \textit{How many normal modes has this system?}\\

\textbf{b. Continuous }\\

Consider now a continuous system of particles confined to a length $L$ and fixed borders. \textit{Which are normal wave lengths ($\lambda_n$) and the normal frequencies ($\nu_n$) in terms of $\nu$(the speed of waves in the medium)?} \textit{Is it correct to think that this system has infinite normal modes?}. If it does not have infinite normal modes, \textit{give a order of magnitude of the number of normal modes.}
